# About project

**i have make this project on 2 mouth**

Project(mouth-1): writing a real project "Labor exchanges". In this mouth(october), I set up a project, connected libraries, created a project structure, connected the project to a database using docker and docker-compose, and created tables in the database.

Project(mouth-2):I created repositories, models and learned how to use them in API handlers using dependency injection and the Depends class. Also, I showed an example of how authentication is created using JWT technology. And we figured out in more detail how to use swagger(OpenAPI) for requests to our application.

**As a result, we got a ready-made CRUD application on FastAPI.**

# Advantages of this project for my experience

The first thing I learned was how to work with FASTAPI and work and connect the database.Second, I learned how to make a CRUD application on it.And the third of course is the experience for the backend.

# Cons of this project for my experience

First, I still don't understand docker and I don't think it's necessary in this project, just because of my lack of experience, I just decided to take on a difficult task for experienced developers. The second did not fully understand how FASTAPI works for API, since I did not make an API, but a crud application. Therefore, I will continue to study FASTAPI as I have not fully studied it, but I know it well.
