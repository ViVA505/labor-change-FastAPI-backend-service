# About project

**i have been makeing this project 4 2 mouth lol)))))))))ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€**

Project(first month): writing a realğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ project "Labor exchanges" lmao))))). In month october, I set up a projectğŸ’€ğŸ’€, connected librariesğŸ’€ğŸ’€, created a project structureğŸ’€ğŸ’€, connected the project to a database using docker and docker-composeğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€, and created tables in the databaseğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€.

Project(mouth two):I created repositoriesğŸ’€, models and learned how to use them in API handlers using dependency injection and the Depends class.ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ Also, I showed an exampleğŸ¤”ğŸ¤”ğŸ¤”ğŸ¤” of how authentication is created using JWT technologyğŸ˜¬ğŸ˜¬ğŸ˜¬ğŸ˜¬ğŸ˜¬ğŸ˜¬ğŸ˜¬. And we figured out in more detail how to use swagger(OpenAPI) for requests to our application. Bruh ima deadğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€))))))))).

**As a result, we got a ready-made CRUD application on FastAPI.**

# Advantages of this project for my experience

The first thing I learned was how to work with FASTAPI and work and connect the database.Second, I learned how to make a CRUD application on it.And the third of course is the experience for the backend.

# Cons of this project for my experience

First, I still don't understand docker and I don't think it's necessary in this project, just because of my lack of experience, I just decided to take on a difficult task for experienced developers. The second did not fully understand how FASTAPI works for API, since I did not make an API, but a crud application. Therefore, I will continue to study FASTAPI as I have not fully studied it, but I know it well.

BRO THIS CODE IS SICKğŸ¥¶ğŸ¥¶ğŸ¥¶ğŸ¥¶ğŸ¥¶ğŸ¥¶ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ˜±ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€ğŸ’€
